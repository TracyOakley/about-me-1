        <h2>Little About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I was born in the states, but went back to South Korea after 2 years and lived there for about 18 years. As soon as I graduated high school, I came back to the states, Seattle, Washington. I took some college credits and did a lot of part time jobs, mostly cashier, server, and cook in the kitchen. Then, I wanted to change how I live so I join ed the army reserve a few years ago. Thanks to the army, I got some opportunities to study, and then here I am learning coding at Code Fellows.
